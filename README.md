### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Roman
#### I am a beginner frontend developer. 
My first programming language that I started learning was python. However, since I tried Javascript, I definitely decided to become a front-end developer. I started my journey to Frontend in November 2020. It all started with the study of HTML and CSS, with the help of various printed materials and materials from the Internet. I have been learning Javascript since August 2021.

Skills: JS / HTML / CSS / SASS /
